# What is a Varisai?

A varisai is a practice pattern used in Carnatic music that follows a systematic progression of swaras (musical notes). 

## Basic Swaras
The seven basic swaras in Carnatic music are:
- Sa (S)
- Ri (R)
- Ga (G)
- Ma (M)
- Pa (P)
- Dha (D)
- Ni (N)

## How Varisai Works

1. Start with an initial pattern of notes (first line)
2. For each subsequent line, shift each note to the next swara in sequence

### Example

Let's break down a simple varisai:

**First line:**
```
S R G M G R
```

**Second line:**
Each note shifts to the next swara in sequence:
- S → R
- R → G
- G → M
- M → P

This gives us:
```
R G M P M G
```

This pattern continues, with each note shifting to the next swara in the sequence: S→R→G→M→P→D→N.

## Usage in Practice

Varisais are fundamental exercises in Carnatic music that help students:
- Memorize the progression of swaras
- Develop voice control and pitch accuracy
- Build muscle memory for common note patterns
- Understand the relationships between different swaras

## Important Notes

1. The progression always follows the fixed order: S→R→G→M→P→D→N
2. After reaching Ni (N), the sequence typically wraps back to Sa (S)
3. The pattern can be practiced in different speeds and variations
4. Maintaining rhythm and timing is crucial while practicing varisais
